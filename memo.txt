* dumb-init
    - a simple process supervisor and init system
	designed to run as PID 1 inside minimal container enveronments
	such as Docker.
    - in case of running a simle process or service without normal init systems
	often leads to incorrect handing of proccesses and signal,
	and can have problems such as container that can't be normally stopped,
	or leaking containers that should have been destroyed.
    - dumb-init acts as PID 1 and immediately spawns your command
	as a child process, taking care to properly handle
	and forward signals as they are recived.
